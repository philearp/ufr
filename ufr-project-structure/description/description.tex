\section*{Project Description}

A simple heirarchy is defined to allow organisation of the UFR data.

\dirtree{%
.1 Projects.
.2 Experiments.
.3 Samples.
.4 Tests.
.5 Pulses.
}

\begin{itemize}
  \item{
    \textbf{Projects} are a collections of \textbf{experiments}.
    An example project may be `RaDIATE Titanium 2020`.
    These can be used by the user to distinguish between work packages, or to separate work for different customers.
  }
  \item{
    \textbf{Experiments (sn-curve)} comprise the batch of individual \textbf{samples} that are to be tested to build the s-n curve.
    These can be used to logically group samples of a similar material, or of a similar irradation condition, to aid organisation of the data.
    An example experiment may be `Irradiation dose comparison on Ti-6Al-4V'.
  }
  \item{
    \textbf{Samples} contain the information describing the physical sample, such as the dimensions, material, and sample preparation steps.
    Each \textbf{sample} will have finite element modelling performed to relate sample deflection to stress.
    Each \textbf{sample} can undergo one or more \textbf{tests}, although most samples will only undergo a single test if the sample is taken to failure.
  }
  \item{
    A \textbf{test} can either be a `step test', where a sequence of \textbf{pulses} are performed at ever-increasing amplitude, or a `constant-amplitude test', where a single \textbf{pulse} is given.
    A tilt-calibration is performed at the start of each test.
  }
  \item{
    A \textbf{pulse} is the application of a constant-amplitude vibration to a sample.
    This is currently implemented in LabVIEW as a `Programmed Vibration'.
    Each pulse begins with a seek.
    During a pulse, QPD data, Dino-Lite images and ultrasonic data are saved. 
  }
